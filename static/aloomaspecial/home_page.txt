                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px; font-size: larger; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">1. How much do roofing shingles actually weigh, and how does that affect my dumpster choice?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Roofing shingles are one of the heaviest common construction materials. A single layer of asphalt shingles from a 1,500 sq ft roof can weigh over 2 tons. When you call, tell us the square footage of your roof and the number of layers being removed. This allows us to recommend a roll off dumpster size (usually a 20-yard) with the appropriate tonnage allowance to prevent overage fees.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">2. I manage a retail store. What is the difference between your roll-off service and our regular weekly trash pickup?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Our roll off dumpster rental in USA is for large volumes of waste from specific projects, like a renovation, a seasonal clear-out, or an excess of shipping materials. Your regular weekly pickup is for the small, day-to-day garbage generated by employees and customers. We are the solution for the big jobs that your regular service can't handle.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">3. For a school carnival, can we put leftover food waste in the dumpster?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Yes, food waste from the event is perfectly acceptable to put in the garbage dumpster rental. We just ask that all liquids are drained and that the food is bagged to help keep the container clean and minimize any potential odors.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">4. What is the most common reason a dumpster delivery might be delayed?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The most common reasons for a delay are an obstructed delivery area (like a parked car in the way) or unsafe access conditions (like extremely slick mud or a very steep, icy driveway). Ensuring the placement area is clear and accessible is the best way to guarantee an on-time delivery.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How do you protect the surface of a parking lot or driveway from getting scratched?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We take property protection very seriously. Our drivers are trained to be extremely careful, and we always recommend placing wooden planks down on the surface before the roll off container is delivered. This provides a simple but effective barrier between the container's steel wheels and the pavement.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">6. Can we get a discount for a non-profit or school fundraising event?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Yes! We are proud to support our local community. Please call our office and speak with one of our team members about your event. We are always happy to offer special partnership pricing for schools and registered non-profit organizations.</p>
